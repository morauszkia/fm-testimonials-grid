## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid with grid template areas
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using grid template areas seems to me the most straightforward way to build complex layout using CSS Grid. Paired with grid-template-columns to have columns equally sized, one can easily create the template for any grid, be that as complicated as one can conceive of.

### Useful resources

- [grid-template-areas @MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - This helped me a lot with using the template area approach
